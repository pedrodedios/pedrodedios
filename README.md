## Hi there 👋

- I am Pedro, and my passion for physics has shaped both my academic and professional journey. I completed an M.Sc. in Theoretical Physics, where I worked on the Spin Foam approach to Quantum Gravity, exploring the fundamental structure of spacetime.

- Alongside theoretical research, I also contributed to applied physics, particularly in Optics. I worked in Adaptive Optics, focusing on optimizing deformable mirrors to correct atmospheric aberration, a crucial step in improving imaging quality in astronomy and other optical systems.

- This profile showcases several of the projects I have developed along the way, written in Fortran, Julia, Python, and Mathematica. You will find simulations, numerical methods  that reflect my path through science and computation.

- If you have any questions about my work or want to connect, feel free to reach out. I am always happy to discuss physics, coding, or collaboration opportunities!
